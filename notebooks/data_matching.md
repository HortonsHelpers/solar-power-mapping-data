Data matching ideas
===================

Location coordinate matching
------
1. Provide a 5 number summary of the difference between converted x/y coords for REPD and the lat/lon coords of REPD tagged installations in OSM to see if any/many are different/wrong
2. Perform simple matching based on lat/lon with REPD entries to OSM and MV
3. Deduplicate OSM and MV polygons/coords
