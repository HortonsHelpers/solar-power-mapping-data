OSM: OpenStreetMap solar PV objects for the UK. Approx 120,000 small-scale PV and 900 solar farms. The data is in OSM's pbf format, and it's extracted from OSM database as of 2019-11-17. It's structured data. Also included an XML version.

Dan S notes: A word about "primary keys" - objects in OSM have identifiers and they're generally stable, though they're not guaranteed persistent (if a user deletes an object and then maps it again as a completely new object, there's not much we can do about that). The FiT data contains no primary key at all. The REPD data does have unique identifiers (hooray!). For about 900 solar farms in OSM, we've added a tag "repd:id" which allows you to connect an OSM solar farm directly to its corresponding entry inREPD.
