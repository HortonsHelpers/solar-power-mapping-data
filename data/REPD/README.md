REPD: Official UK data from the "renewable energy planning database". This only has the larger solar farms (approx 1000) and geolocations are imprecise (mainly unreliable street addresses). However it includes useful metadata - capacity, install date, etc.

Note: the majority of REPD solar farms (approx 900) have already been entered into OSM.
