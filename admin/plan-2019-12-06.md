## People

- Dan Stowell (PI)
- Damien Tanner, Jack Kelly, Dan Travers (Open Climate Fix)
- Jamie Taylor (Sheffield)
- Possibly others?

## Goal

Aggregate "UK solar PV data" into structured format, which "can be accessed".

UK solar PV data is:
- OpenStreetMap data
  - subset of objects tagged as solar installations sent by Dan Stowell, also used in the "OCF OSM instance" run by Damien 
- FIT spreadsheets from Ofgem
- Renewable Energy Planning Database from gov.uk
- Machine Vision dataset from Lucas Kruitwagen at Oxford (but not open, at least yet)
