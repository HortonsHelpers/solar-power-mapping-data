% Notes for REG/Dan catchup on Monday, 9 December


# AGENDA

* Intros (meet academic collabs)
* Updates from James and Ed on dataset investigations and spinup
* Discuss next steps including:
      - infrastructure decisions
      - plans with Sheffield (extra undergrad data annotations and/or validation of our aggregated data)

# Updates

## What is the overlap between REPD and OSM current dataset?

|                  |   Records |
|------------------|----------:|
| OSM              | ~ 126,000 |
| REPD             |     5,686 |
|------------------|----------:|
| OSM              |           |
| - tagged as REPD |       893 |


- Can we match geographically? 
  - some that are tagged the same in OSM and REPD are > 100 km distant
  
- What's in OSM that we could in principle use for F-S?

- What is the actual infrastructure? Is it, say, a script that (a) downloads most recent data (OSM,
  FiT, REPD), identifies new entries, matches those in OSM, and then produces a file suitable for
  upload?
